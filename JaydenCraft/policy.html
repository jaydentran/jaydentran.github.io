                    <p class="content-box">The Privacy Policy outlines how i-Link Research Solutions Pty Ltd (“i-Link”)
                        and LiveTribe handles your Personal Data in terms of our online member community (LiveTribe),
                        our online surveys, our member reward programs, competitions, our websites and our proprietary
                        online platforms.</p>
                    <p class="content-box">i-Link manages and operates an online community of willing participants
                        called LiveTribe. Members of the LiveTribe community have double-opted in to participate in
                        online surveys and discussion groups. All personal information collected and stored for this
                        community is housed in a separate location to i-Link Data.</p>
                    <p class="content-box">This policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, why we collect
                        that Personal Data, the other parties with whom we may share it, and the measures we take to
                        protect the security of the data. It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect
                        to your Personal Data, and how you can contact us to update your contact information or ask
                        questions about our privacy practices.</p>
                    <p class="content-box">This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your Personal Data in
                        the context of surveys administered by third parties. In these situations, neither i-Link nor
                        LiveTribe are the host of the survey and the survey platform, and the survey results or survey
                        data are and will be controlled by the host of the survey. Please refer to the relevant host’s
                        privacy policy to learn more about that host’s privacy practices.</p>

                        your Personal Data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide
                        Personal Data when requested, you may not be able to benefit from i-Link or LiveTribe if that
                        information is necessary to provide you with i-Link or LiveTribe or if we are legally required
                        to collect it.</p>

                        <li>We ask you to provide certain Personal Data when you register for an account through our

                            occupation (optional), education (optional), and gender. This information helps us to better
                            target the projects we invite you to participate in.</li>
                        <li>In addition, we collect Personal Data you provide when you participate in a survey or when
                            you redeem points for vouchers (e.g. a PayPal email). This also includes a unique member
                            identification number (session ID) we assign to you when you sign up for an account and the
                            responses you provide in your profiling survey. Sensitive Personal Data includes but is not
                            limited to data that indicates your health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or
                            sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin and religious practice. We will
                            always allow a Participant to opt-out of providing this information.</li>
                        <li>Sensitive information is always stored and reported in aggregate form. Where required by
                            law, we will ask for your consent to the processing of your sensitive Personal Data or to

                        <li>From time to time, we may ask you to submit content that you upload or transmit to our
                            survey platforms, such as photos and videos. We will always seek explicit consent from you
                            prior to asking you to upload any such material. In the event you upload these files to a
                            platform not managed by i-Link or by LiveTribe, please refer to the relevant host’s privacy
                            policy to learn more about that host’s privacy practices.</li>

                            stored on S3 Amazon Cloud servers located in undisclosed data centers in Sydney Australia.
                            i-Link does not directly market products or services to any research Participant. i-Link may
                            also disclose personal information in circumstances where we are authorised or required to
                            do so by law, and in circumstances where we consider it appropriate to do so in order to
                            ensure that laws are complied with.</li>
                        <li>i-Link may send emails with the sole purpose of inviting someone to participate in a survey
                            or discussion group on behalf of our Clients. Email lists will have been obtained from
                            Clients for this purpose. Email invitations distributed by i-Link are only sent to
                            Participants who have, to the best of our knowledge, given their consent to receive such
                            emails. Every email sent by i-Link includes the ability to unsubscribe from receiving
                            further emails. Unsubscribe data is provided back to our Clients for removal from their
                            lists at the end of a project or in two weeks, whichever is first.</li>
